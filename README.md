## Project Overview

Climate change is affecting all of the natural world, and the habitat and survival of many species of birds are being threatened. In order to understand the effects of climate change on birds, it is crucial to record and track songbird activity. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can correctly identify the songs of eight common and local birds of Michigan. This device will record the bird song and relevant environmental information. In doing so, we must consider and further define our goals for power usage, connectivity, longevity, and cost. Our ultimate goal is to create a product that can automatically report this data and is suitable for deployment in nature spanning weeks or months. Our highest level stakeholder, Backyard Brains, hopes that their investment will help us learn more about the behavior of songbirds and the broader implications of climate change.
