# Projects

Backyard Brains hosts experiment development projects throughout the year. Some of these turn into our experiments, some of these are for our own intellectual curiosity, and some turn into publications in peer reviewed journals. Here you will find each project which contains our open-source schematics, docs, and code.

The projects are:

 * Songbird - A device that can collect environmental and geo-positioning data while detecting and identifying birdsongs automatically.

 * Electric Fish - A collection of projects designed around the recording and micro-stimulation of weakly electric fish. For electric fish that produce "spikes", we are developing a long-term recording device to listen for spiking activity and record the waveforms at highspeed.  For "wave" electric fish, we are developing a device that listens to the frequency of the electric fish, and to initiate a jamming avoidance response by adding an artifical fish in the water next to it that emits a frequency similar to the fish.
