# Electric Fish Projects

Backyard Brains currently is developing 2 seperate (but related) Electric Fish Projects:

* Recorder - Detect spikes from electric fish and store them for analysis.  For electric fish that produce "spikes", we are developing a long-term recording device to listen for spiking activity and record the waveforms at highspeed

* Stimulator - For "wave" electric fish, we are developing a device that listens to the frequency of the electric fish, and to initiate a jamming avoidance response by adding an artifical fish in the water next to it that emits a frequency similar to the fish.

These projects include hardware (PCBs and 3d models), software, firmware, and documentation.
