# Mosquito Love Songs

## Background 

My summer project with Backyard Brains will focus on studying the Mosquito Love Song! Specifically, I will be analyzing the Aedes Agypti mosquito, or more commonly known as the yellow fever mosquito. These mosquitoes transmit dengue, the most important mosquito virus that affects humans to date. The interesting thing about these mosquitoes is the way they communicate with each other- by merely flapping their wings! This transmitted frequency forms the basis for all mating interactions. Male mosquitoes have a wing beat frequency of about 600 Hz, females 400 Hz. Yet, when they mate, they are matching tones not at this fundamental frequency but at a harmonic near 1200 Hz. The problem is that the literature reports that male mosquitoes can hear only up to a few hundred Hz and females are completely deaf! 

For my research, I will be designing methodology to record the frequency patterns of mosquito wings as they begin this mating process. Iâ€™m hoping through analysis of these patterns, I will be able to reveal key parameters and cues in the mosquito mating process so that the scientific community can come up with new ways to help control mosquito populations and limit the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.
