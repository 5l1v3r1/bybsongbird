1, Use model knn27.pkl python27. I am still trying to improve the model but at least knn27.pkl can be run with python27
2, If you have problem related to librosa, please comment the librosa and uncomment wavfile.
3, If you have problems for ffmepg, google 'download and add ffmepg to path', change the directory 
of AudioSegment.converter to 'yourpath/bin/ffmepg.exe' (if you use mac, this should be 'yourpath/bin/ffmepg')
If you have any other problem, just let me know on slack.

for 3s model
default setting
number_of_chunk=100
clf = joblib.load('path\knn27_3s.pkl')#the model
threshold=0.4#0.2,1,0
length=3000#3000,5000
