                Climate change is affecting all of the natural world, and the habitat and survival of many species of
                birds are being threatened. In order to understand the effects of climate change on birds, it is crucial
                to record and track songbird activity. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can
                correctly identify the songs of eight common and local birds of Michigan. This device will record the
                bird song and relevant environmental information. In doing so, we must consider and further define our
                goals for power usage, connectivity, longevity, and cost. Our ultimate goal is to create a product that
                can automatically report this data and is suitable for deployment in nature spanning weeks or months.
                Our highest level stakeholder, Backyard Brains, hopes that their investment will help us learn more
                about the behavior of songbirds and the broader implications of climate change.
